The following project is a basic web page made with HTML, CSS and Java Script for a French restaurant located in Barcelona. It consists of 5 pages:

- Home page with a slider of features services;

- About Us page with a short text description and embedded video from Youtube which can be played on the page;

- Services page with description of the services, photo for each and Request Information buttons which are linked to the Contacts page;

- Contact page, consisting of the contact form with an option to choose topic of the question and add comments (valid only on client side), and image of the outside of the restaurant with contact info;

Each page has the same header (with logo, address and the navigation menu), footer (with selected navigation menu) and breadcrumbs.


Java Script was used for a slider gallery on the Home page, representing featured services, and for the photo gallery in order to be able to see full size of each picture on click. No external libraries, like Bootstrap, were used for that purposes.

Project files are structured by the layer into sub folders - HTML, CSS, Java Script and used images.

Additional documents include Project plan and wireframes layouts in PDF.

After testing the page did't turn out to be cross-platform compatible which must be improved. Also improvements on increasing responsiveness are required.
